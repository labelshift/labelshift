# quant

Python library for *quantification* -- estimating the class prevalences in an unlabeled data set.

This library serves a two-fold purpose:

  - easily apply state-of-the-art quantification algorithms to the real problems,
  - benchmark novel quantification algorithms against others.



Benchmark for quantification algorithms used to find class distributions in machine learning.
