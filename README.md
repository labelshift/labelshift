# quant

Python library for *quantification*: estimating the class prevalences in an unlabeled data set under the prior probability shift assumption.
This module is created with two purposes in mind:
  - easily apply state-of-the-art quantification algorithms to the real problems,
  - benchmark novel quantification algorithms against others.

It is compatible with any machine learning framework.
