# Label Shift

Python library for *label shift* (known as prior probability shift, target shift) and *quantification* (estimating the class prevalences in an unlabeled data set under the prior probability shift assumption).
This module is created with two purposes in mind:
  - easily apply state-of-the-art quantification algorithms to the real problems,
  - benchmark novel quantification algorithms against others.

It is compatible with any classifier using any machine learning framework.
